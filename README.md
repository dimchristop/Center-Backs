# Center-Backs
Identification and evaluation of center-backs, who can limit goal threat, using event &amp; tracking data.
There are 2 different Power BI files.

CBs.pbix covers center-backs from 10 csv files of event and tracking data. After proccessing these 10 csv files I exported the center-backs with their stats at centerbacks.xlsx.

xml_centerbacks.pbix covers center-backs from 40 xml files of event and tracking data. After proccessing these 40 xml files I exported the center-backs with their stats at Centerbacks_from_xml.xlsx.

XML-CBs is a jupyter notebook containing all the pre-proccessing steps I did in order to create the Centerbacks_from_xml excel file.
